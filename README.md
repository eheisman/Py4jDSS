# Py4jDSS
Example code to use Py4j to connect C Python to DSSVue.  This ~~probably~~ isn't fast, secure, or stable.  This method requires a good understanding of object introspection in Java.  The user has been warned.

See http://eaheisman.blogspot.com/2015/03/accessing-hec-dss-files-from-c-python.html for usage details.
